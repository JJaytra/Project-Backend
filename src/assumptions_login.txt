def auth_login(email, password):
    return user_id
    
1. We should assume that the account has been registered already
    -> if not then check if there is an account with that email address and raise error if there isn't
    
2. Check if the email adaress is valid:
    ->  '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}$'
    
3. There should be only one account with the same email address = one user

4. Check that the password matches the given email address
